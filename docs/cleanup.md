I'll analyze the codebase and propose a comprehensive plan to make the libraries more efficient and easier to manage. Let me first examine the code structure and patterns.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I've identified several areas where we can improve efficiency and manageability. Here's my comprehensive plan:

1. **Create a Base API Client Class**
- I notice that several API clients (`HiroApi`, `AlexApi`, `VelarApi`, etc.) share common functionality
- Create an abstract base class `BaseApiClient` that implements:
  - Common HTTP methods (_get, _post, etc.)
  - Rate limiting
  - Retry logic
  - Caching
  - Error handling
  - Logging standardization
  - Type hints and documentation standards

2. **Implement a Service Registry Pattern**
- Create a service registry to manage all API client instances
- This will make it easier to:
  - Initialize services with proper configuration
  - Share instances across the application
  - Manage dependencies between services
  - Control lifecycle of services

3. **Standardize Error Handling**
- Create a hierarchy of custom exceptions
- Implement consistent error handling patterns across all libraries
- Add proper error context and logging

4. **Enhance Configuration Management**
- Create a centralized configuration management system
- Implement environment-based configuration
- Add configuration validation
- Support for hot reloading of configurations

5. **Improve Logging System**
- Enhance the existing logger.py to include:
  - Structured logging
  - Log rotation
  - Log levels per component
  - Performance metrics logging
  - Request/Response logging for API calls

6. **Add Dependency Injection**
- Implement a dependency injection container
- Make services more testable and maintainable
- Reduce tight coupling between components

7. **Implement Async Support Consistently**
- Add async versions of all API methods
- Standardize async patterns across the codebase
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Add proper async context management

8. **Add Monitoring and Metrics**
- Implement performance monitoring
- Add metrics collection
- Create health checks for services
- Add proper telemetry

9. **Improve Testing Infrastructure**
- Create base test classes for common test scenarios
- Implement proper mocking utilities
- Add integration test framework
- Add performance test framework

10. **Documentation and Type Hints**
- Enhance documentation with more examples
- Add proper type hints throughout
- Create documentation generation pipeline
- Add API documentation

11. **Create Development Tools**
- Add CLI tools for common development tasks
- Create scaffolding tools for new services
- Add development utilities

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any of these improvements? I can start with the most impactful ones first, such as the Base API Client and Service Registry, which will make it much easier to add and manage new services in the future.

Let me know which aspects you'd like to prioritize, and I can provide more detailed implementation plans for those specific areas.
