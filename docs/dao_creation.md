# DAO Creation Process

This document outlines the DAO creation process in the AIBTC platform, detailing how user requests are processed, validated, and executed.

## Overview

The DAO creation process involves several steps:
1. Tweet Analysis and Parameter Extraction
2. Token Creation and Asset Generation
3. Collective Creation
4. Contract Deployment

## Detailed Flow

### 1. Tweet Analysis and Parameter Extraction

The process begins when a user tweets a DAO creation request to `@aibtcdevagent`. The tweet is processed by the `DAORequestAnalyzer` class, which:

- Removes mentions and common prefixes
- Extracts parameters in both structured and simple formats
- Generates smart defaults for missing parameters

Example tweet formats:
```
.@aibtcdevagent create dao MyDAO
```
or
```
.@aibtcdevagent create dao name:MyDAO symbol:MYDA supply:1000000000
```

### 2. Token Creation and Asset Generation

Once parameters are extracted, the system creates a token record and generates necessary assets:

1. **Token Record Creation**:
   - Creates a database record with token details (name, symbol, description, etc.)
   - Uses the `TokenCreate` model for validation
   - Returns a Token object that is converted to a dictionary for further processing

2. **Asset Generation**:
   - Generates token image using AI
   - Creates token metadata JSON
   - Uploads both to storage
   - Updates token record with asset URLs

### 3. Collective Creation

A collective is created to manage the DAO:

1. **Collective Record Creation**:
   - Creates a database record with collective details
   - Uses the `CollectiveCreate` model for validation
   - Returns a Collective object that is converted to a dictionary

2. **Token-Collective Binding**:
   - Links the token to its collective
   - Updates token record with collective ID

### 4. Contract Deployment

Finally, the system deploys the necessary smart contracts:

1. **Contract Deployment**:
   - Deploys token contract
   - Deploys governance contracts
   - Uses `BunScriptRunner` to execute deployment scripts

2. **Contract Record Updates**:
   - Updates token record with contract information
   - Creates capability records for each deployed contract
   - Links all contracts to the collective

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **TokenServiceError**: Handles token creation and asset generation failures
- **ValidationError**: Catches invalid parameter formats
- **DeploymentError**: Manages contract deployment issues

## Data Models

Key models used in the process:

```python
class TokenCreate(TokenBase):
    name: str
    symbol: str
    description: str
    decimals: str
    max_supply: str

class CollectiveCreate(CollectiveBase):
    name: str
    mission: str
    description: str

class CapabilityCreate(CapabilityBase):
    collective_id: UUID
    type: str
    contract_principal: str
    tx_id: str
    status: str
```

## Best Practices

1. **Parameter Validation**:
   - All parameters are validated using Pydantic models
   - Smart defaults are provided when possible
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Each step has specific error types
   - Errors include detailed context for debugging
   - Failed operations are properly cleaned up

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - All database operations use proper models
   - Relationships between entities are maintained
   - Contract deployments are verified before recording

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**:
   - Consider batch processing for high volume
   - Implement caching for frequent operations
   - Optimize asset generation pipeline

2. **Security**:
   - Add additional validation for token parameters
   - Implement rate limiting for DAO creation
   - Add contract verification steps

3. **User Experience**:
   - Provide more flexible input formats
   - Add progress updates during creation
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed steps
