# infrastructure Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder handles core infrastructure services, including job management, scheduling, and application startup. It focuses on background processing, monitoring, and initialization, using async patterns and dynamic configurations for reliable operation.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - [__init__.py](__init__.py): Initialization file for the package.
  - [scheduler_service.py](scheduler_service.py): Manages job scheduling.
  - [startup_service.py](startup_service.py): Handles application startup logic.

- **Subfolders**:
  - [job_management/](job_management/): Job execution and monitoring. [job_management README](./job_management/README.md) - Job scheduling and tasks.

## Relationships and Integration
Services here initialize jobs from job_management/ and integrate with backend for queue management (app/backend/models.py). Used during app startup in app/main.py and interacts with integrations for event triggering.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: services Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - [Down: job_management README](./job_management/README.md)

## Additional Notes
Configure scheduling intervals carefully to avoid overload; monitor via metrics in job_management/.
