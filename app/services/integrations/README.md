# integrations Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder orchestrates external integrations, including webhook handling and API clients for blockchain and platform services. It provides extensible structures for integrating with third-party systems, using abstract bases and dataclass models for configuration and data exchange.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - __init__.py: Initialization file for the package.

- **Subfolders**:
  - webhooks/: Base and specific webhook services. [webhooks README](./webhooks/README.md) - Webhook processing.
  - hiro/: Hiro API integrations. [hiro README](./hiro/README.md) - Blockchain data access.

## Relationships and Integration
Integrations here are utilized in job tasks (app/services/infrastructure/job_management/tasks/) for event-driven processing and monitoring. They interact with backend for data storage (app/backend/supabase.py) and may trigger communications via app/services/communication/.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: services Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - [Down: webhooks README](./webhooks/README.md)

## Additional Notes
Add new subfolders for additional integrations; ensure configurations are loaded from app/config.py.
