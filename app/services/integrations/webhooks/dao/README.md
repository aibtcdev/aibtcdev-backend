# dao Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder provides webhook handling for DAO-related events, including parsing and processing. It defines models and services for DAO webhooks, using dataclasses for structure. Key technologies include async processing and integration with base webhook classes.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - handler.py: Handles parsed DAO webhook events.
  - __init__.py: Initialization file for the package.
  - models.py: Defines DAO webhook data models.
  - parser.py: Parses incoming DAO webhook payloads.
  - service.py: Main service for DAO webhook processing.

- **Subfolders**:
  - (None)

## Relationships and Integration
Extends WebhookService from app/services/integrations/webhooks/base.py. Used in app/api/webhooks.py for routing, with models integrating into broader webhook system.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: webhooks Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - (None)

## Additional Notes
Focus on DAO-specific events; validate payloads against models before handling.
