# dao Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder handles DAO-specific webhook parsing and processing, focusing on DAO events. It includes models, parsers, and handlers for structured DAO data management, using dataclass patterns for event representation.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - [handler.py](handler.py): Manages DAO event handling logic.
  - [__init__.py](__init__.py): Initialization file for the package.
  - [models.py](models.py): Defines dataclass models for DAO events.
  - [parser.py](parser.py): Parses DAO webhook payloads.
  - [service.py](service.py): Implements DAO webhook service.

- **Subfolders**:
  - (None)

## Relationships and Integration
This folder parallels the chainhook folder's structure and integrates with the parent folder's base.py for common webhook functionality. It may feed parsed data into backend models (app/backend/models.py) or trigger infrastructure jobs.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: webhooks Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - (None)

## Additional Notes
Designed for DAO-specific extensions; align with Chainhook handlers for consistent event processing.
