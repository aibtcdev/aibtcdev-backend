# services Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder centralizes all service-layer components, orchestrating business logic for AI, communications, integrations, infrastructure, processing, and core operations. It uses modular subfolders for separation of concerns, employing async services and dependency injection for scalable application logic.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - [__init__.py](__init__.py): Initialization file for the package.

- **Subfolders**:
  - [ai/](ai/): AI services and workflows. [ai README](./ai/README.md) - AI orchestration.
  - [communication/](communication/): Communication channels. [communication README](./communication/README.md) - Message sending services.
  - [core/](core/): Core DAO services. [core README](./core/README.md) - DAO business logic.
  - [infrastructure/](infrastructure/): Job and startup management. [infrastructure README](./infrastructure/README.md) - Background processing.
  - [integrations/](integrations/): External integrations. [integrations README](./integrations/README.md) - Webhooks and APIs.
  - [processing/](processing/): Data processing. [processing README](./processing/README.md) - Social data handling.

## Relationships and Integration
Services here are dependency-injected into API endpoints (app/api/) and interact with backend (app/backend/) for data access. They drive job tasks and use utilities from app/lib/ for common functions.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: app Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - [Down: ai README](./ai/README.md)
  - [Down: communication README](./communication/README.md)
  - [Down: core README](./core/README.md)
  - [Down: infrastructure README](./infrastructure/README.md)
  - [Down: integrations README](./integrations/README.md)
  - [Down: processing README](./processing/README.md)

## Additional Notes
Services are extensible; add new subfolders for emerging needs. Ensure async compatibility across services.
