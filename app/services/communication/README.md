# communication Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder provides services for external communications, including Discord, Telegram, and Twitter integrations. It handles message sending and bot services, using factory patterns and webhook support for multi-channel notifications.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - __init__.py: Initialization file for the package.
  - telegram_bot_service.py: Implements Telegram bot functionality.
  - twitter_service.py: Handles Twitter (X) interactions.

- **Subfolders**:
  - discord/: Discord-specific services. [discord README](./discord/README.md) - Discord message sending.

## Relationships and Integration
Services are invoked by job tasks like tweet_task.py and discord_task.py in app/services/infrastructure/job_management/tasks/. Depend on config for API keys and integrate with processing/ for data preparation.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: services Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - [Down: discord README](./discord/README.md)

## Additional Notes
Secure API credentials; implement retry logic for unreliable networks.
