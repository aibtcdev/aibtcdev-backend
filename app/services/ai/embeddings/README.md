# embeddings Folder Documentation

## Overview
This folder provides services for generating text embeddings using AI models like OpenAI. It includes async methods for embedding text, focusing on vector representations for search and similarity tasks.

## Key Components
- **Files**:
  - embed_service.py: Implements EmbedService for text embedding.
  - __init__.py: Initialization file for the package.

- **Subfolders**:
  - (None)

## Relationships and Integration
Embeddings are used in workflows like dao_proposal_embedder.py in app/services/infrastructure/job_management/tasks/ and integrate with simple_workflows in app/services/ai/simple_workflows/. Depends on config for API keys.

## Navigation
- **Parent Folder**: [Up: ai Folder README](../README.md)
- **Child Folders** (if applicable): 
  - (None)

## Additional Notes
Monitor embedding model costs; cache results where possible.
