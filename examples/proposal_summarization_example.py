    We propose to establish a community treasury management committee consisting of 5 elected members
    who will oversee the allocation and investment of DAO funds. The committee will be responsible for:
    
    1. Reviewing and approving treasury investment strategies
    2. Monitoring portfolio performance and risk metrics  
    3. Reporting quarterly to the DAO membership on financial status
    4. Implementing transparent governance processes for fund allocation
    
    This committee will help professionalize our treasury management while maintaining
    decentralized oversight through community elections every 12 months. The total budget
    requested is 50,000 tokens for operational expenses over the first year.
    
    Expected outcomes:
    - Improved treasury performance through professional management
    - Enhanced transparency and accountability in fund allocation
    - Risk mitigation through diversified investment strategies
    - Quarterly reporting to maintain community trust
