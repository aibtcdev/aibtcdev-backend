Always use types using typing library when doing python code. Make sure to avoid creating new code that might already exist. 
Make sure to add logging using the configure_logger. 
Always look for any code that would reference code that gets modified so that it doesn't break any existing code.
Make sure to remove any unused imports. 
Also make sure to always create or update unit tests for anything you create.
